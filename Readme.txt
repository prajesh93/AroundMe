This was the project created by me along with my 2 team members at the HackRPI held in 2016.
It makes use of TripAdvisor as well as Google API.

Using the application:
Open the index.html file in your choice of browser
The application will ask you for the permission to access your location. Give that permission to the application
The application will query the Google Geolocation API and fetch in your current latitude and longitude.
Select an option if you are Bored or Hungry.
Once the option is selected, press the 'Let's do this thing!' button next to it.
The application will query the TripAdvisors API and get information about nearby restaurants or nearby hangout places based on the option selected.


**Trip advisor changed their API policy and no longer allow to use the API keys for research or educational purpose. So the application will not work. However, you can view the source code and understand that. The code has been properly commented to make it easy for you to understand.
